## Minecraft Stress Test

This Minecraft world is designed to push your device to its limits! It's a collection of increasingly challenging TNT-based stress tests, perfect for testing your computer's performance and seeing how much it can handle.

**How it Works:**

* **Multiple Difficulty Levels:**  Choose from five difficulty levels:
    * **Very Easy:**  A gentle introduction to the stress test.
    * **Easy:**  A manageable challenge for most machines.
    * **Medium:**  Starts to get more demanding.
    * **Hard:**  A real test of your machine's capabilities.
    * **EXTREME:**  Get ready to see your computer struggle!
* **TNT Overloads:** Each difficulty level features a different configuration of TNT explosions designed to push your device's rendering engine and processing power.
* **Command Block Control:** The TNT is controlled by command blocks, so no manual activation is required.
* **Visual Spectacle:**  Watch the explosions unfold in a dazzling display of particle effects and visual chaos.

**Requirements:**

* **Render Distance:**  For the command blocks to function properly, you need to set your render distance to at least 6 chunks.
* **Minecraft Java Edition:**  This world is designed for Minecraft Java Edition.

**Future Improvements:**

* **More Difficulty Levels:** I'm planning on adding even more difficult levels for the truly hardcore stress testers.
* **Customizable Settings:**  I want to give players the ability to customize the test's intensity, including things like explosion size and frequency.
* **Performance Metrics:**  I'm working on adding features to track the performance of your device during the stress tests to give you a more accurate picture of your system's capabilities.

**Disclaimer:**

This world is intended for entertainment and testing purposes only. Excessive stress testing can potentially damage your hardware. Use at your own risk!

**Enjoy the chaos!**
